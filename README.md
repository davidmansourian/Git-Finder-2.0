This is an improved version of [this Git Finder](https://github.com/davidmansourian/CodingTestHedvig) that I wrote as a coding test. The two apps were written approximately one year apart.

There is significant improvement in this version of the application:
- Cleaner business logic
- Cleaner file structure
- Better separation of concerns
- More thought into interactions between different components
- Caching
- Unit tests covering majority of app (See issues for what is left to do).

This version also incorporates the latest frameworks such as "@Observable" and "@Model" announced during WWDC 23.
