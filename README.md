This is an improved version of [this Git Finder](https://github.com/davidmansourian/CodingTestHedvig) that I wrote as a coding test. The two apps were written approximately one year apart.

There is significant improvement in the business logic of this improved version of the application. The file structure is much cleaner and the separation of concerns is better.
This version incorporates the latest frameworks such as "@Observable" and "@Model" announced during WWDC 23. Unit tests has been written for majority of objects.
